## Notes
This config uses my purps [purps-colorscheme](https://github.com/CaydendW/purps-colorscheme). It match the background included in the i3 config. GTK, terminal, vim and rofi are included there.  
Run fishcolors.fish to get my fish colorscheme.  
The colorscheme for VSCode has not been added. Find it in the [purps-colorscheme](https://github.com/CaydendW/purps-colorscheme) repo.
